# Problem? "You must provide a username, eithervia --username or via env[NOVA_USERNAME]"
# Solution = Make sure you have sourced your openrc file
# by using the following command
# . ~/openrc

# Find the image you want to boot:
nova image-list

# Find the flavor/size of the instance you want to boot
nova flavor-list

image=$(nova image-list | grep maverick[^-] | awk '{ print $2 }')

# create a keypair
nova keypair-add myKeypair > key.pem

# set permissions on keyfile
chmod 600 key.pem

# Use the Nova CLI to boot an instance based on our SimpleImage
nova boot --flavor 1 --image ${image} --key_name myKeypair mySecondInstance

# List all the instances paying attention to their Status
nova list

# Once the instance is active, ssh to it
#ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@10.0.0.3 # Replace with the IP of the instance

# Use the Nova CLI to delete an instance
#nova delete 1

# Listing the instance should show that our instance has been deleted
nova list
